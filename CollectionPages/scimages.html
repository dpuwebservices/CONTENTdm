The <em><strong>Exhibits from the DePaul University Libraries and Partners Digital Collection </strong></em>preserves selected related materials from physical exhibits mounted by the DePaul University Libraries. These exhibits showcase and explain the significance of individual objects and their relationships to other materials and the large collections of which they are a part.</p>
